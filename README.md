# FreshAir
i went to bed trying to remain awake for fear of breaking this lovely dream of you and me!  wondering if i sleep, these dreams would drift away into darkness never to return again, i kept my eyes open!  a beautiful smile  that’s hard to forget you entered my soul like a breath of fresh air!  swimming deep in darkness i came to the surface for air, and i have not gone back  ever since that day!  ever since you sneaked into my soul, life has changed completely struggling to push darkness away i was toying with life!  i don’t understand how it happened, i was on the road to nowhere you came in and took hold of my soul putting me back on to the path of happiness!  i thought i knew what love was, i thought i knew everything, now sitting here writing this, i feel i am so lost without you!
